# Goal
The goal of this repo is to take publicly available and provide tools to sift
through everything. This code has a focus on housing so whatever is dumped here
will have a focus on that

## Features (in various states of implementation)
- Given a voting record of a legislator, what have they do that has been
  specific to an address
  - Basically done? Given a data set, I haven't been able to see an example of a
    decision that didn't pertain to a street given the code written
- Overlap of voting record. Given a legislator, how does their voting record line up?
  - It seems like everybody votes `aye` for everything though :/
  - Not really done yet, but not complicated to implement
